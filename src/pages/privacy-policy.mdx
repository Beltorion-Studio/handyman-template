        ## Data Retention

        We retain personal information only for as long as necessary to fulfill the purposes for which it was collected, including:
        - Providing the requested services.
        - Complying with legal obligations (e.g., tax or accounting requirements).
        - Resolving disputes or enforcing agreements.

        Once the retention period expires, we securely delete or anonymize your data to prevent identification.

        ## Security

        We take the security of your personal information seriously and implement appropriate technical and organizational measures to protect it. These measures include:
        - **Encryption**: Data is encrypted during transmission to prevent unauthorized access.

        - **Regular Monitoring**: Continuously monitoring systems for vulnerabilities and threats.

        While we strive to use commercially acceptable means to protect your data, no method of transmission over the Internet or electronic storage is 100% secure. We are committed to continuously improving our safeguards.

        ## International Transfers

        If your data is transferred across international borders, we ensure it is protected by appropriate safeguards. We comply with applicable data protection laws to ensure your information remains secure regardless of location.
