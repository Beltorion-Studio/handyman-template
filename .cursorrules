# Cursor Rules for Handyman Template Project

## Project Overview

This is a handyman service website template built with Astro, TypeScript, and Tailwind CSS.

## Technology Stack

- **Framework**: Astro
- **Language**: TypeScript
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS
- **Package Manager**: pnpm (not npm)
- **Editor**: Cursor (not VS Code)

## Code Style Guidelines

### General Principles

- Follow DRY principle (Don't Repeat Yourself)
- Write clean, readable, and maintainable code
- Use early returns for better readability
- Prefer descriptive variable and function names
- Use const instead of functions where possible
- Use Types instead of interfaces
- Use named functions instead of arrow functions

### Event Handling

- Event functions should be named with "handle" prefix
- Example: `handleClick` for onClick, `handleKeyDown` for onKeyDown

### Accessibility

- Implement accessibility features on interactive elements
- Include tabindex="0", aria-label, on:click, and on:keydown attributes
- Ensure proper semantic HTML structure

### Styling Guidelines

- Use Tailwind CSS utility classes
- Prefer Tailwind color utility class names over hex codes
- Use "class:" instead of ternary operators in class tags when possible
- Minimum font size should be text-base, prefer text-lg for better readability
- Avoid xs or small font sizes unless specifically requested

### Import Paths

- Use '~/...' import paths instead of relative '../../...' paths
- Example: `import { Button } from '~/components/ui/Button'`

### Comments

- Minimize comments - only comment complex functions
- Do not comment HTML and CSS
- Avoid generic or redundant information

### Animations

- Use GSAP for animations when needed
- Avoid random shortcuts - study the theme carefully before making changes

### File Structure

- Components go in `src/components/`
- UI components go in `src/components/ui/`
- Styles go in `src/styles/`
- Configuration goes in `src/config/`
- Utilities go in `src/lib/`

### Build and Commands

- Do not suggest or run build commands automatically
- Provide commands without executing them - user will run manually
- Do not suggest installing packages globally

### Design Consistency

- Do not change the design when implementing features
- Maintain existing design patterns and styling

## Project-Specific Notes

- This is a handyman service template
- Uses Astro's component-based architecture
- Includes blog functionality with MDX support
- Has responsive design with mobile-first approach
- Includes trust stats, CTA sections, and social links

## Code Quality

- Write bug-free, fully functional code
- Leave no TODOs, placeholders, or missing pieces
- Ensure all imports are included
- Verify code is complete and finalized
- Focus on readability over performance
